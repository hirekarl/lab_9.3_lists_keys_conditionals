## Overview
### Viewer Instructions
1. Run the following in the terminal:

```bash
cd task-manager && npm i && npm run dev
```

2. Navigate in the terminal to http://localhost:5173.

### Submission Source
Top-level application behavior can be found in [`./task-manager/src/App.tsx`](./task-manager/src/App.tsx).

### Reflection
#### 1. How did you ensure unique keys for your list items?
>

#### 2. What considerations did you make when implementing the filtering functionality?
>

#### 3. How did you handle state updates for task status changes?
>

#### 4. What challenges did you face when implementing conditional rendering?
>


## Assignment Instructions
### Lab Overview
In this lab, you will create a Task Management application that demonstrates dynamic list rendering, proper key usage, and conditional rendering. You will practice creating TypeScript React components that handle lists of data, implement filtering, and show different states based on task properties. This lab focuses on list rendering, key management, conditional rendering, and component composition using React and TypeScript.

### Workplace Context
Imagine you are a frontend developer working on a task management system. Your team needs a component that can display a list of tasks, filter them by status, and show different visual states based on task properties. The component should be reusable, type-safe, and handle various task states efficiently.

This lab will help you practice building components that work with dynamic data and implement proper React patterns for list rendering.

### Activity Tasks
#### 1.Component Implementation
- [ ] Implement each component according to its interface requirements.
- [ ] Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces.
- [ ] Implement list rendering with unique keys.
- [ ] Add conditional rendering based on task properties.

#### 2.List Management
- [ ] Render the task list with proper key props.
- [ ] Implement filtering functionality.
- [ ] Handle task status changes.
- [ ] Implement task deletion.

#### 3. Visual Feedback
- [ ] Show different styles based on task status and priority.
- [ ] Implement hover and active states.
- [ ] Add visual indicators for task properties.

#### 4.Component Composition
- [ ] Compose components to create a complete task management interface.
- [ ] Handle prop passing between components.
- [ ] Implement proper event handling.
